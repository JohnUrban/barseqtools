1. There are 5 proteins being looked at in 2 conditions.
	Proteins:
		1. L1
		2. L25
		3. S2
		4. S15
		5. Bet1
	Conditions:
		1. Galactose (before depletion)
		2. Glucose (after depletion)
	Total:
		5 proteins x 2 conditions = 10 sample types
2. There are 3 replicates of each sample type: 3 reps x 10 sample types = 30 total samples
