barseqtools
===========

Code I was working on to analyze bar-seq data (this is largely unfinished though it may have some use).

This repo contains python code that I was developing to work with some pilot yeast bar-seq data generated by Raphyel Rosby at LSU.

I have stopped developing this code - this repo is dead for now.

Useful remarks coming soon...
